# Dotplanning — Dot-Release Kickoff Planner

You are planning a TruePPM **dot release** (a `0.x` minor milestone) at the moment it
opens — *before* any feature branch is cut. Your job is to turn a loose milestone
(a roadmap row + a pile of issues) into a **full, sequenced plan**, and to surface
every **missing asset** and **unanswered question** while they are still cheap to fix
— i.e. before anyone writes code.

This skill is the **begin-gate bookend** to `/pre-release`:

- `/pre-release` is the **end-gate** — "what becomes a public commitment we can't take back?" Run before tagging.
- `dotplanning` is the **begin-gate** — "what are we actually building, what's missing, and what must we decide first?" Run at kickoff.
- `architect` operates one altitude **below** this — it designs a single feature/subsystem and emits an ADR. `dotplanning` operates at **milestone altitude**: it decides *which* features need an `architect` pass at all, and in what order. Do not duplicate `architect`'s per-feature design work here; instead, flag which features still need it.

**One-time gate, not a loop.** Like `/pre-release full`, run this **once** at the
start of a dot release. Re-running mid-cycle re-discovers adjacent gaps and turns into
whack-a-mole. If scope changes materially mid-release, run it again deliberately and
say why.

---

## Arguments

- `[milestone]` — optional explicit milestone title (e.g. `0.4`). If omitted, resolve the next open milestone automatically (Step 0).
- `--no-file` — produce the plan and HTML report but do **not** offer to file gap issues.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve the target milestone

The target is the **dot release we are about to start building** — the next open minor
milestone strictly greater than the last shipped/just-cut release. Never hardcode a
version.

Resolution order:
1. Read `packages/scheduler/pyproject.toml` — the `version` field is the canonical
   **last shipped** release (e.g. `0.2.0a1` → shipped line is `0.2`). release.sh treats
   it as authoritative.
2. If `[milestone]` was passed as an argument, use it directly (still load the shipped
   version for the pre-1.0 framing below).
3. Otherwise pick the smallest open milestone strictly greater than the shipped version:
   ```bash
   glab api "projects/trueppm%2Ftrueppm/milestones?state=active" 2>/dev/null \
     | python3 -c "import json,sys; ms=json.load(sys.stdin); print('\n'.join(m['title'] for m in sorted(ms, key=lambda m: [int(x) for x in m['title'].split('.') if x.isdigit()] or [0])))"
   ```
4. Confirm in one line: "Planning the **$MILESTONE** dot release (last shipped: $SHIPPED). Proceed?" Wait for confirmation.

Export `$MILESTONE` and `$SHIPPED`. Every query, the report, and any filed issue
reference `$MILESTONE` — never a hardcoded string.

### Pre-1.0 framing

TruePPM is pre-1.0. State this at the top of the plan: between `0.x` minors the public
API, WS event schema, settings, and migration shape can still change. That means a
missing-asset finding is a **planning gap to close now**, not a contract break — but an
**open question that crosses the OSS/Enterprise boundary, a trust boundary (auth/sync),
or the public scheduler pip surface** is high-stakes even pre-1.0, because reversing it
after code ships is the expensive case. Rank those questions first (Step 4).

---

## Step 1 — Gather scope inputs (run in parallel)

Collect first, reason later. Run these together.

### 1a. Roadmap scope (source of truth for intent)

Read `packages/website/src/content/docs/overview/roadmap.md`. This is the **single
source of truth** for what each version is meant to deliver (and the version-tense
authority per CLAUDE.md). Extract the `$MILESTONE` row and the bullet list of intended
themes/features. Note its classification (Underway / Planned) — everything in this plan
must stay **future-tense** in any doc reference, since `$MILESTONE` has not shipped.

### 1b. Milestone issues (what's already tracked)

```bash
glab issue list --repo trueppm/trueppm --state opened --milestone "$MILESTONE" --per-page 100 --output json 2>/dev/null \
  | python3 -c "
import json,sys
for i in json.load(sys.stdin):
    labels=','.join(i.get('labels',[]) or [])
    print(f\"#{i['iid']:>4}  [{labels}]  {i['title'][:90]}\")
"
```

If `glab issue list --search` returns empty (known gotcha in this repo), fall back to
the REST search:
```bash
glab api "projects/trueppm%2Ftrueppm/issues?scope=all&milestone=$MILESTONE&state=opened&per_page=100" 2>/dev/null
```

### 1c. Deferred findings inherited from the last cycle

Prior `/pre-release` and `/voc-audit` runs file 🟡 findings against future milestones.
Pull anything already aimed at `$MILESTONE` so the plan accounts for it:
```bash
glab issue list --repo trueppm/trueppm --state opened --label "$MILESTONE" --per-page 50 2>/dev/null | head -40
```

### 1d. Personas (who each theme serves)

Read `.claude/personas.md`. For each intended theme in the roadmap row, identify the
primary persona(s) it serves. A theme that maps to **no** target persona, or only to an
Enterprise-governance persona, is a scope flag for Step 4.

### 1e. Existing surface (what already exists to build on)

For each intended theme, locate the existing code surface so you can tell *new* assets
from *extensions of existing* ones. Use `Explore` (medium breadth) per theme rather than
reading whole trees — you need the conclusion (does a screen/endpoint/model for this
exist?), not the file dumps. Typical anchors:
- Screens/flows: `packages/web/src/features/<domain>/`
- Endpoints/serializers: `packages/api/src/**/views.py`, `serializers.py`
- Models: `packages/api/src/**/models.py`
- Docs: `packages/website/src/content/docs/`

---

## Step 2 — Build the feature → asset map

This is the core of the skill. For **every** intended feature in the `$MILESTONE` scope,
decompose it into the assets a full-stack TruePPM feature needs, and mark each asset's
status. Use this checklist per feature — it mirrors the project's own gate chain so a gap
here is a gate that will fire later:

| Asset class | What to check | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| **Issue** | Is there a tracked issue? (boundary: Enterprise-scoped work must live in `trueppm-enterprise`) | Step 1b/1c |
| **Screens** | Which web screens/modals/panels does it add or change? Do they exist? | `features/<domain>/` |
| **Flows** | The end-to-end user journey (empty state → happy path → error/permission state). Is any step undefined? | personas + ux-design |
| **API** | New/changed endpoints, serializers, WS events | `views.py` / `serializers.py` |
| **Model** | New/changed models + migration implications | `models.py` |
| **Design** | Does it need an `architect` ADR and/or a `ux-design` pass, and has one happened? | `docs/adr/`, design notes |
| **Docs** | Which `docs/` pages must be added/updated (future-tense) | `docs/.../` |
| **Tests** | The three-layer obligation (pytest / vitest / Playwright) | CLAUDE.md |

For each feature, classify every asset as:
- 🟢 **exists** — already in the tree or already tracked, ready to extend
- 🟡 **planned-not-built** — there's an issue/ADR but no implementation yet (expected — this is the backlog)
- 🔴 **missing** — no issue, no design, no screen, no decision: a true gap the plan must close **before** coding

A 🔴 on **Screens** or **Flows** is the headline output the user asked for: a feature
that's on the roadmap but whose screens/flows have never been designed. Surface these
prominently.

> **Boundary check.** For any feature whose scope smells like cross-program coordination,
> portfolio governance, org identity governance (SAML/SCIM/LDAP/enforced SSO), audit
> trail, or approval workflows, flag it for the `enterprise-check` agent **before** it
> gets an issue in the OSS tracker. Basic OIDC/OAuth login is OSS — do not bounce it.
> (See the Two-Repo Rule in CLAUDE.md.) A misfiled boundary is the most expensive gap to
> fix after code ships.

---

## Step 3 — Sequence the plan into gated workstreams

Turn the feature map into an **ordered** plan. Order by:
1. **Dependency** — backend models/endpoints before the screens that consume them; shared infra before features that build on it.
2. **Boundary/architecture risk** — features needing an `architect` or `enterprise-check` decision go first, because their outcome reshapes downstream work.
3. **Persona value** — within a tier, sequence by which target persona's journey it unblocks (per personas.md priorities).

For each workstream, state the **gate chain it will trigger** (from CLAUDE.md's fast-paths
table) so the user sees the real cost up front. Examples:
- New full-stack feature → `/voc` → `architect` → `ux-design` → implement → pre-MR gate cluster → `ux-review` → `test-scaffold` → `changelog` → `/mr`
- Backend-only endpoint → `architect` → pre-MR gate cluster → `test-scaffold` → `changelog` → `/mr`
- Settings sub-page wiring → `ux-review` → `rbac-check`+`security-review`+`regression-check` → `test-scaffold` → `changelog` → `/mr`

Do **not** run any of those gates here — `dotplanning` only **names** the chain each
workstream will need. Running them is the development work that follows this plan.

---

## Step 4 — Open questions to answer before coding

List the decisions that must be made **before** the first branch is cut, ranked by cost
of getting them wrong (highest first). For a pre-1.0 dot release, that ordering is
roughly:

1. 🔴 **Boundary calls** — OSS vs Enterprise classification for any ambiguous feature (needs `enterprise-check`). Moving a feature between repos after implementation is the worst case.
2. 🔴 **Trust-boundary calls** — anything touching auth, sync, board membership, or file handling (needs `threat-model` + `architect`).
3. 🔴 **Public-surface calls** — changes to the scheduler pip API, WS event schema, or settings names that will be awkward to reverse.
4. 🟡 **Design-direction calls** — flows with more than one reasonable shape, where `ux-design` needs a steer before it can produce a single proposal.
5. 🟡 **Scope calls** — features on the roadmap row that have no persona, no issue, or look like they belong in a later milestone.

Phrase each as a **decision the user must make**, with the options and a recommendation —
not an open-ended musing. These are the questions to put in front of the user at kickoff.

---

## Step 5 — Delight wedge (one, optional)

TruePPM's go-to-market is adoption-first. Once per dot release — **here, not as a
standing per-feature step** — pose exactly one question: *is there a single moment in
this milestone's scope we can make genuinely delightful as an adoption wedge?*

Keep it to **one** concrete, low-cost idea tied to a feature already in scope (not net-new
scope). If nothing in scope qualifies, say so and move on. The point is a wedge that helps
acquisition, not a backlog of "game-changing" ideas — idea generation is not the
constraint at pre-1.0; shipping and distribution are. Do not let this section inflate the
plan.

---

## Step 6 — Emit the HTML report to ~/Downloads

Produce a **self-contained** HTML file (inline CSS, no external assets) at:

```
$HOME/Downloads/dotplanning-<MILESTONE>-<YYYYMMDD>.html
```

Get the date with `date +%Y%m%d` (never assume it). Write the file with the `Write` tool.
The report is the deliverable the user keeps — make it complete and standalone, mirroring
the on-screen plan. Required sections, in order:

1. **Header** — `TruePPM — $MILESTONE Dot-Release Plan`, generation date, last-shipped version, and a "Pre-1.0 planning gate" badge.
2. **Scope summary** — the roadmap row verbatim (themes), the count of tracked issues, and the count of inherited deferred findings.
3. **Feature → asset matrix** — one table; rows = features, columns = the asset classes from Step 2, cells = 🟢/🟡/🔴 with a one-line note. This is the centerpiece.
4. **Missing assets (🔴)** — ranked list, screens/flows first, each with what's missing and the cheapest way to close it.
5. **Open questions** — the Step 4 list, ranked, each phrased as a decision with options + recommendation.
6. **Sequenced plan** — the Step 3 workstreams in order, each with its gate chain.
7. **Delight wedge** — the single Step 5 idea (or "none in scope this cycle").
8. **Appendix — inputs reviewed** — roadmap row, issue IDs pulled, persona file, explore anchors. So the plan is auditable.

Use the project severity palette so it reads at a glance:
- 🔴 missing/blocking → `#b42318` (red)
- 🟡 planned/should-decide → `#b54708` (amber)
- 🟢 exists/ready → `#067647` (green)

Keep the CSS minimal and legible (system font stack, max-width ~960px, light background,
generous padding, a sticky header is nice-to-have). The file must open correctly by
double-click with no network access.

After writing it, print the absolute path and a 5-line summary (milestone, # features
planned, # 🔴 missing assets, # open questions, the delight wedge in one phrase) to the
chat.

---

## Step 7 — Offer to file gap issues (skip if `--no-file`)

For each 🔴 missing asset and each unanswered 🔴 question the user approves, offer to file
a tracked issue against `$MILESTONE` so the gap enters the normal flow:

```bash
glab issue create --repo trueppm/trueppm \
  --milestone "$MILESTONE" \
  --label "<area>,planning" \
  --title "<gap title>" \
  --description "<body, heredoc — include the asset/question context and the recommended close>"
```

- Respect the boundary: anything `enterprise-check` flags as Enterprise must be filed in
  `trueppm-enterprise`, **not** the OSS tracker (the `boundary:check` CI job fails the
  pipeline if an OSS issue carries the `enterprise`/`portfolio` label).
- Cross-link issues that share a feature.
- Filing the gaps as issues is what makes the next step (actual development) start from a
  clean tracked backlog — which is the whole point of running this at kickoff.

---

## What dotplanning does NOT do

- **Write feature code or branches** — it plans; development follows.
- **Run the per-feature gates** (`architect`, `ux-design`, `security-review`, etc.) — it only names which chain each workstream will trigger.
- **Replace `/pre-release`** — that's the end-gate before tagging; this is the begin-gate after the prior tag.
- **Loop** — one invocation per dot release. Re-run only on a deliberate, material scope change.
- **Generate net-new scope for the delight wedge** — exactly one idea, tied to scope already present, or none.

## Anti-patterns to refuse

- Planning a milestone that hasn't been confirmed in Step 0 (never assume the version).
- Re-running mid-cycle and re-filing gaps already tracked.
- Letting the delight section balloon into a feature-idea dump.
- Filing an Enterprise-scoped gap into the OSS tracker.
- Past/present-tense version claims for `$MILESTONE` in any doc-facing text — it is unshipped, so future-tense only (CLAUDE.md version-status rule).
