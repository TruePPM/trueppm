title: Unified data model
description: How one task hierarchy powers Waterfall, Agile, and Hybrid workflows without translation layers or duplicate data.
---

Most "hybrid" project management tools are two tools bolted together. TruePPM is not. Every view — Gantt, Board, Sprints, WBS, Schedule — reads and writes the same rows in the same database. There is no sync, no translation, no eventual consistency.

This page explains the data model that makes this possible.

## The core entity: Task

Every item of work in TruePPM — a WBS phase, a deliverable task, a sprint story, a milestone — is a single `Task` row. The row carries fields that are relevant in different contexts, and different views surface different subsets of those fields.

```
Task
 ├── Identity
 │     id            UUID primary key
 │     name          string
 │     wbs_path      ltree  (e.g. "1.2.3" — position in WBS hierarchy)
 │     project       FK → Project
 │
 ├── Scheduling (CPM — Waterfall + Hybrid)
 │     duration          integer  (working days)
 │     planned_start     date     (PM's committed start — gates CPM early_start)
 │     early_start       date     (CPM forward-pass output)
 │     early_finish      date     (CPM forward-pass output)
 │     late_start        date     (CPM backward-pass output)
 │     late_finish       date     (CPM backward-pass output)
 │     total_float       integer  (working days of schedule slack)
 │     free_float        integer
 │     is_critical       boolean  (on the critical path)
 │     is_milestone      boolean  (zero-duration gate event)
 │
 ├── Monte Carlo (probabilistic forecasting)
 │     optimistic_duration     integer  (3-point estimate, working days)
 │     most_likely_duration    integer
 │     pessimistic_duration    integer
 │
 ├── Execution (Board — all methodologies)
 │     status          BACKLOG | NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | REVIEW | COMPLETE
 │     assignee        FK → User
 │     percent_complete  integer
 │     actual_start    date     (auto-set on IN_PROGRESS transition)
 │     actual_finish   date     (auto-set on COMPLETE transition)
 │
 ├── Agile (Sprints — Agile + Hybrid)
 │     sprint          FK → Sprint  (null = project backlog)
 │     story_points    integer      (nullable — agile estimate)
 │     remaining_points integer     (live burndown signal)
 │
 └── Flags
       is_milestone    boolean  (zero-duration gate)
       is_subtask      boolean  (depth-1 checklist item, no independent schedule)
       notes           text
```

No methodology owns any field. A waterfall PM fills in `duration` and leaves `story_points` null. A scrum team fills in `story_points` and uses `duration` to let CPM compute a delivery date. A hybrid team fills in both — the PM owns duration and the team owns points — and both views stay live simultaneously.

## The WBS hierarchy

Tasks are arranged into a tree using a PostgreSQL `ltree` column (`wbs_path`). A path of `"1.2.3"` means: first top-level phase → second child → third grandchild.

```
Project
  └── 1       Phase: Discovery          (duration auto-rolled up from children)
        ├── 1.1   Task: Stakeholder interviews
        ├── 1.2   Task: Requirements doc
        └── 1.3   Milestone: Discovery sign-off
  └── 2       Phase: Build
        ├── 2.1   Task: API design       ← sprint FK set → Sprint 3
        ├── 2.2   Task: Frontend         ← sprint FK set → Sprint 3
        └── 2.3   Task: Integration test ← sprint FK set → Sprint 4
  └── 3       Phase: Deploy
```

The **same tree** is the source for every view:

| View | Reads from the WBS tree | Key fields used |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
| **WBS / Table** | Full tree, indented | `wbs_path`, `name`, `status`, `duration` |
| **Gantt / Schedule** | Committed tasks (non-BACKLOG) | `early_start`, `early_finish`, `total_float`, `is_critical`, dependency edges |
| **Board** | Non-BACKLOG tasks, grouped by WBS phase | `status`, `assignee`, `sprint`, `story_points` |
| **Sprints** | Tasks where `sprint_id = current_sprint` | `story_points`, `remaining_points`, `status` |
| **Overview** | Aggregate rollups | burndown, velocity, CPM forecast, Monte Carlo P80 |

No data is copied between views. The Board's phase lanes are WBS phases. The Gantt's bars are the same rows the Board's cards render. The sprint burndown reads `remaining_points` from the same rows the Gantt uses for float.

## How each methodology uses the model

### Waterfall

A waterfall PM works entirely with `duration`, `planned_start`, dependencies, and CPM output fields. The Board is still available but secondary. Story points are left null. Sprints are not created.

```
Typical waterfall task:
  name:           "Develop payment API"
  duration:       10
  planned_start:  2026-02-03
  early_start:    2026-02-03   ← CPM output
  early_finish:   2026-02-14   ← CPM output
  total_float:    0            ← on the critical path
  is_critical:    true
  sprint:         null         ← not sprint-managed
  story_points:   null         ← not estimated in points
  status:         NOT_STARTED  ← board column
```

The Gantt renders the bar from `early_start`/`early_finish`. The Board shows the task card in the NOT_STARTED column. Neither view requires any duplicate row.

### Agile

An agile team works entirely with `sprint`, `story_points`, `remaining_points`, and `status`. The Gantt is hidden (via the Agile methodology preset). CPM is still computed in the background — `duration` defaults to 1 day for backlog items — but the team never looks at it. The WBS is flat or minimal.

```
Typical agile task ("story"):
  name:           "User can reset password"
  duration:       1            ← default; CPM runs but results ignored
  sprint:         Sprint 4     ← sprint membership
  story_points:   5            ← agile estimate
  remaining_points: 3          ← updated daily by assignee
  status:         IN_PROGRESS
  early_start:    null or ignored by the team
```

The Board renders this as a card in the IN_PROGRESS column. The sprint burndown consumes `remaining_points`. No separate "agile database" exists.

### Hybrid

A hybrid team uses both sets of fields on the same rows. The PM sets `duration` and `planned_start`; the team sets `story_points`. A task can live in Sprint 3 (agile planning) and also be on the critical path (CPM scheduling). The Monte Carlo engine uses `optimistic_duration` / `most_likely_duration` / `pessimistic_duration` to compute delivery confidence.

```
Typical hybrid task:
  name:              "Implement auth service"
  duration:          8          ← PM's scheduling estimate
  optimistic_duration:  5
  most_likely_duration: 8
  pessimistic_duration: 13
  planned_start:     2026-03-10
  early_start:       2026-03-10  ← CPM
  total_float:       0           ← critical
  sprint:            Sprint 5    ← team's execution context
  story_points:      13          ← team's complexity estimate
  remaining_points:  8           ← current burndown
  status:            IN_PROGRESS
```

Raj sees a Gantt bar with float and critical-path colouring. Maya sees a sprint card with story points and remaining effort. They're looking at the same database row. When Maya moves the card to COMPLETE, `actual_finish` is set, CPM re-runs, and Raj's Gantt updates in real time via WebSocket — without either of them touching a sync button.

## Why no translation layer

Most hybrid tools are integrations: Jira ↔ MS Project, Azure DevOps ↔ Project Online, Smartsheet ↔ Jira. These have three failure modes:

| Failure | Integration tool | TruePPM |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Eventual inconsistency** | "Gantt is as of last sync, 4 hours ago" | Same row — always live |
| **Lossy translation** | Epic → Project task loses story points; Project task → Jira loses float | No translation; both fields on the same row |
| **Permission divergence** | Tom has Jira access; Sarah has Project access. Information leaks both ways. | One RBAC check per request, one role per user per project |

The data model is the integration. There is nothing to sync.

## The methodology preset is a view filter

Setting a project to Waterfall, Agile, or Hybrid hides tabs in the UI — it does not change, migrate, or delete any data. A project can be switched from Agile to Hybrid and back without consequence. API routes are never gated by methodology; the preset is purely a UI signal.

See [Methodology preset](/features/methodology-preset/) for the tab visibility matrix.
