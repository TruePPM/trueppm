title: Outbox & Record Retention
description: How TruePPM bounds its transactional outbox and audit tables with purges, and how to tune, run on demand, or disable each retention window.
---


:::note[Added in 0.2 (alpha)]
This page documents functionality added in **TruePPM 0.2**, available since the `0.2.0-alpha.1` pre-release (May 31, 2026). 0.2 is an alpha release; the first beta is planned for 0.4.
:::

TruePPM runs several **transactional outbox** tables (schedule requests, MS Project
imports, webhook deliveries, sprint-close requests) plus historical records (object
history, task runs). Each is kept bounded by a Celery Beat purge so the tables stay
small, index scans on the drain paths stay fast, and backups don't bloat.

You can tune retention two ways: from the **System health → Retention & purge** editor in
the UI (workspace admins), or via Django settings / environment variables (the default,
applied when no UI override exists). The UI is the fast path for a running deployment; the
settings remain the source of the defaults.

## Editing retention from the UI

Workspace admins (Django `is_staff`) manage retention at **Settings → Workspace → System
health → Retention & purge**. From there you can, without editing env/settings or
restarting pods:

- **Edit each retention window** and **enable/disable** a purge per table.
- **Configure the purge schedule** (frequency, time of day, on-failure behavior).
- **Run a purge now** or **dry-run** it.
- **Review the last several purge runs**.

A UI change writes a **`RetentionPolicy` override** that takes precedence over the
matching Django setting. The settings below remain the **defaults** — a deployment that
never opens the editor behaves exactly as it did before (ADR-0173).

:::caution[Lowering a window is irreversible]
Lowering a retention window makes more data **immediately purge-eligible** on the next
run. The editor shows how many rows (and roughly how much space) become eligible *before*
you save, but the deletion itself **cannot be undone**. Saving a lower value only changes
the window — the next scheduled or manual run enforces it.
:::

## Retention settings

| Setting | Default | Unit | What it bounds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | days | django-simple-history object-change records |
| `TASK_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | days | Completed/failed/canceled `TaskRun` records |
| `TRUEPPM_IMPORT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `7` | days | Terminal (`DONE`/`DEAD`) `ImportRequest` rows, including their multi-MB `file_content_b64` blobs |
| `TRUEPPM_WEBHOOK_RETENTION_DAYS` | `7` | days | Terminal (`SUCCESS`/`FAILED`) `WebhookDelivery` rows |
| `TRUEPPM_SYNC_BATCH_RETENTION_HOURS` | `24` | hours | `SyncBatch` mobile-upload idempotency rows past the dedup window (ADR-0082) |
| `TRUEPPM_PROJECT_SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | days | Soft-deleted ("trashed") `Project` rows, hard-deleted with all child data (see [Trashed projects](#trashed-projects-are-hard-deleted-after-the-window) below) |

**One purge coordinator, not many nightly jobs.** The outbox and history tables were
originally purged by separate nightly Beat jobs at staggered UTC times. As of ADR-0173 the
retention windows above are purged by a **single retention purge coordinator** that runs
all six as one unified run on the schedule below (default **02:00 UTC daily**). Each
per-table task still exists and remains dispatchable, but none is independently scheduled.

**Workspace export archives are purged separately.** A completed workspace export
(Settings → Archive / Delete → *Export all data*, ADR-0174) writes a full `.tar.gz` to
object storage. `TRUEPPM_EXPORT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `7`; `None` disables) bounds how
long the download link stays valid; past it the standalone nightly `purge_expired_exports`
Beat task (04:20 UTC) deletes both the `WorkspaceExportJob` row **and** its stored archive
file. It is not folded into the retention coordinator above because it reaps a storage
object, not just a database row.

**`TRUEPPM_SYNC_BATCH_RETENTION_HOURS` is in hours, not days.** Unlike the other knobs,
this window is measured in **hours** because it doubles as the mobile sync upload **dedup
window**: a re-uploaded batch carrying the same `client_batch_id` replays its stored
response only while its `SyncBatch` row is within this window. The default of 24h
comfortably covers a device that was offline overnight. This window **cannot be
disabled** — it is always active.

Each value is read from the matching environment variable at startup. To change a default
deployment-wide (rather than per-UI-override), set the env var (or the corresponding Helm
value) and restart the API/worker pods. Example:

```bash
# Keep webhook deliveries for 30 days. The env var takes a positive integer;
# leave it unset to fall back to the default (7). An empty value is invalid.
TRUEPPM_WEBHOOK_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

## Trashed projects are hard-deleted after the window

:::note[Ships in 0.4]
Automatic hard-delete of trashed projects lands in **TruePPM 0.4** (the first beta).
Manual soft delete and `?force=true` hard delete already ship; the *scheduled* purge below
is the 0.4 addition.
:::

Deleting a project is a **soft delete**: the project drops out of every list, board, and
report immediately, but its row and all its child data (tasks, dependencies, sprints,
risks, baselines) are retained so the deletion can be reviewed and — until it is purged —
reversed with a `?force=true` hard delete or restored by an operator.

`TRUEPPM_PROJECT_SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `30`) will bound that grace period.
Once a project has been in the trash longer than the window, the retention coordinator will
**hard-delete** it: the project row and, via database `CASCADE`, its entire child subtree
are permanently removed in one pass. This is the same removal the manual `?force=true`
delete performs, applied automatically on a schedule. Like every retention window it is
**irreversible** and can be tuned or disabled (set the value to `None` in a settings
override) exactly like the others.

:::caution[Age is measured from the delete, not the purge]
A project soft-deleted **before** this feature ships has no recorded delete timestamp
(`deleted_at IS NULL`). Because its age cannot be known, it will be deliberately **never**
auto-purged — the safe default is to keep it. Such a legacy trashed project can still be
removed manually with a `?force=true` delete; only projects deleted after the feature ships
carry a timestamp and age out automatically.
:::

## Purge schedule

The coordinator's schedule is operator-configurable (Settings → Retention & purge):

- **Frequency** — `Daily`, `Weekly`, or `Off`. `Off` disables *scheduled* purging
  entirely; you can still run a purge on demand.
- **Time of day** — a UTC time. It is **UTC with no DST shift** — `02:00` is always
  02:00 UTC year-round, so the purge window doesn't drift with daylight saving.
- **Day of week** — shown only when frequency is `Weekly`.
- **On failure** — `Continue and flag the failed table` (purge the remaining tables and
  mark the failed one in the run) or `Stop the run on first error` (abort immediately).

Internally, Beat fires the coordinator on a fixed sub-hourly cadence and the coordinator
self-gates: it does nothing outside the configured window and never double-runs the same
window.

## Running a purge on demand

- **Run purge now** — deletes eligible rows immediately across all six tables. It is
  **irreversible** and is protected by a confirmation dialog.
- **Dry run** — counts what *would* be purged and **deletes nothing**. Use it to preview
  impact before committing to a real run.

Both are asynchronous: the request returns immediately and the run appears in the log once
the worker finishes. If a run is already in progress the endpoint responds **409** (a
single-flight guard, so a double-click can't launch overlapping purges). The setting
`RETENTION_PURGE_INFLIGHT_SECONDS` (default `600`) bounds that guard, so a worker that
dies mid-run can't block future runs indefinitely.

## Purge log

The editor shows the most recent purge runs — each with its start time, duration, state
(`ok` / `partial` / `failed` / `running` / `dry run`), how many of the six tables
completed, rows deleted, and bytes freed.

**Counts and sizes are estimates.** The row counts and table sizes shown in the editor
(and the bytes-freed figure in the log) are PostgreSQL **estimates**
(`pg_class.reltuples` / `pg_total_relation_size`). They are fast to compute on large
tables but approximate — treat them as guidance, not an exact ledger.

Once at least one run has been recorded, the **System health overview**'s "Retention
purge" component card reports real state (`ok` / `partial` / `failed`) instead of the
`unknown` it shows before any run exists.

## What is never purged

- **Non-terminal rows.** `PENDING` webhook deliveries and `PENDING`/`DISPATCHED`
  import requests are still in flight — the drain may re-dispatch them — so they are
  excluded from the purge regardless of age. Only terminal rows are eligible.
- **Live business data.** Retention purges target *outbox, history, and trashed* records
  only. **Live** projects, tasks, schedules, and baselines are never touched — a project
  will become eligible only after you have explicitly deleted it (moved it to the trash)
  *and* the soft-delete retention window has elapsed. See [Trashed
  projects](#trashed-projects-are-hard-deleted-after-the-window) below.
- **API-token audit log.** `ApiTokenAuditEntry` rows (project- and
  program-scoped token mint/revoke events) are **never** purged — they are kept
  indefinitely as compliance evidence and have no retention window.

## Why two prefixes?

The older retention knobs (`HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS`, `TASK_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS`) are
unprefixed; the newer ones (`TRUEPPM_IMPORT_RETENTION_DAYS`,
`TRUEPPM_WEBHOOK_RETENTION_DAYS`) carry the `TRUEPPM_` prefix for env-var namespacing in
shared Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets (see ADR-0081). The unprefixed names are kept
as-is — renaming them would break existing deployments.

## Disabling a purge safely

You can disable a purge two ways:

- **From the UI** — toggle the table off in the Retention & purge editor. (Sync batches is
  the exception: it doubles as the sync dedup window and cannot be disabled.)
- **From settings** — set the Django setting to `None` in a settings override, for example
  in a custom settings module layered on `trueppm_api.settings.prod`:

```python
TRUEPPM_IMPORT_RETENTION_DAYS = None  # never purge MS Project imports
```

The corresponding environment variable cannot express `None` — it must be a valid
integer or left unset — so the settings-level disable is a deliberate override, not an env
toggle.

Disabling a purge means the table grows without bound. For `ImportRequest` in particular,
each retained row can hold a multi-megabyte base64 blob; a team running monthly imports
with the purge disabled will accumulate gigabytes of dead rows. If you disable a purge,
pair it with an external archival or `VACUUM`/retention policy at the PostgreSQL layer.

## Forecast snapshots

:::note[Added in 0.3]
Project forecast-snapshot capture was added in **TruePPM 0.3**, available since
the `0.3.0-alpha.1` pre-release (Jun 28, 2026).
:::

Every time the scheduler recomputes a project, TruePPM will record a
`ProjectForecastSnapshot` — the CPM finish date, total float, Monte Carlo P50/P80/P95, and
task counts at that moment — so a PM can see how the project's finish date has drifted over
time. A nightly **floor** task (`scheduling.capture_daily_forecast_floor`, 00:30 UTC)
guarantees at least one snapshot per active project per day even on quiet days, and also
backfills any recompute capture missed by a broker blip. Capture is **best-effort and
post-commit** — a capture failure never blocks or rolls back the recompute.

Unlike the outbox tables above, forecast snapshots are bounded by a **tiered retention
curve** rather than a single age cutoff, because the long tail of monthly points is what
makes a multi-year drift chart useful:

| `FORECAST_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `daily_days` | `90` | Keep **every** snapshot younger than this |
| `weekly_days` | `365` | Between `daily_days` and here, keep **one per ISO week** (the newest) |
| _beyond `weekly_days`_ | — | Keep **one per calendar month** (the newest), kept forever |

The prune runs nightly via the `scheduling.prune_forecast_snapshots` Beat task (04:15 UTC)
and is also exposed as the [`prune_forecast_snapshots` management
command](/administration/management-commands/#maintenance-commands) for on-demand runs. To
change the curve deployment-wide, override `FORECAST_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` in a settings
module layered on `trueppm_api.settings.prod`:

```python
# Keep daily points for 6 months, then weekly to 2 years, then monthly forever.
FORECAST_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION = {"daily_days": 180, "weekly_days": 730}
```

History is read-only at `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/forecast-snapshots/` (any project
member). Snapshots are server-generated; there is no write surface.

:::note[Enterprise]
**Compliance-grade retention is an Enterprise feature.** This page covers basic operational
purge. Compliance-grade retention governance — locked SOC 2/HIPAA floors ("cannot lower
below N days"), a policy-change audit trail, GDPR / legal-hold workflows, and an
immutable **Audit log** retention row — is part of **TruePPM Enterprise** and is
intentionally not in the open-source core.
