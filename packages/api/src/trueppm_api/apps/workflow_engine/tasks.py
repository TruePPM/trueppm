"""Celery tasks for the default workflow backend (ADR-0080 §D).

``advance_workflow_step`` is the work task that executes one step of a workflow
chain: run the step's activity (once-and-only-once), record history, then either
enqueue the next step's outbox row or finish the workflow. It is dispatched by
the backend's ``enqueue_step`` and re-dispatched by ``workflows_outbox_drain``.

This module also owns the engine's Beat tasks: ``workflows_outbox_drain``
(re-dispatch stranded step rows), ``workflows_timer_drain`` (fire due sleep
timers), and ``purge_old_workflow_records`` (retention).

Idempotency under the outbox's at-least-once delivery comes from two guards: the
outbox row's terminal-status check (a re-delivered DONE/DEAD row is a no-op) and
a ``select_for_update`` on the workflow instance that serializes advancement, so
two copies of the same step cannot run the activity concurrently.

This is backend machinery (it may import Celery), not consumer code — it lives
in the app, never under ``workflows/consumers/``.
