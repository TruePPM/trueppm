"""Composable working-calendar resolution (#906, ADR-0251).

A project's effective non-working mask for CPM is the overlay (union) of several
applied calendars: a base ``Project.calendar`` plus zero or more
``ProjectCalendarLayer`` overlays. A day is non-working if *any* applied calendar
marks it so — masks AND-composed, exception ranges unioned.

The fold itself lives in ``trueppm_scheduler.models.Calendar.compose`` (the Apache
package). This module is the Django-side seam: it resolves *which* calendars apply
to a project (through a small resolver registry) and converts them to scheduler
dataclasses via the single ``build_sched_calendar`` primitive.

The resolver registry is the one-way (enterprise → core) extension point
(ADR-0251 §6): OSS registers exactly one resolver (base + overlay layers);
enterprise appends more (per-resource, cross-program calendars) against the same
signature. Because composition is AND-of-masks + union-of-exceptions, any added
resolver is always additive and order-independent, so a new source can never be a
breaking change to an existing project's schedule.
