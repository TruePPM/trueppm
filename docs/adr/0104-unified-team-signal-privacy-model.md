# ADR-0104: Unified Team-Signal Privacy Model + Enterprise Rollup Extension Point

> **Companion ADRs (0.3 agile-team architecture batch).** ADR-0104 = Unified Team-Signal Privacy Model · ADR-0105 = PO Product-Backlog Hierarchy & Scoring · ADR-0106 = Agile/Waterfall Bridge. Where this ADR refers to "the Privacy ADR", "the Backlog ADR", or "the Bridge ADR" it means 0104 / 0105 / 0106 respectively. **ADR-0104** is this document.

## Status
Proposed

> **Erratum (2026-06-06, reconciled in the #553 implementation MR).** The §2 reader
> gate is **`read iff tier <= audience`** (suppress when the requester's band is
> *above* the audience). An earlier draft of §2/§2.1 wrote "suppress when tier <
> audience", which would have left the PM reading velocity by default — contradicting
> Decision-1 and Morgan's hard-NO (the feature's reason for existing). §1's
> "no regression" is about *ordinary members*, not the PM; both §1 and Decision-1
> hold under `tier <= audience` (team reads its own signals; the PM is excluded until
> the team shares upward). The text below is corrected to match.

## Context

Three 0.3 issues each add a control over a team-private signal, and the Agile Coach (Morgan) requires they read as **one coherent privacy model**, not three inconsistent switches:

- **#553** — velocity-visibility gate: today the rolling-velocity series (`velocity_summary`, `services.py:391` — including a per-closed-sprint `sprints[]` array carrying `completed_points`, `services.py:445`) is exposed by `ProjectVelocityView` (`views.py:6182`) gated `[IsAuthenticated, IsProjectMember, IsProjectNotArchived]`. `IsProjectMember` (`permissions.py:101-125`) is **membership-only with NO role floor**, so **every VIEWER+ project member reads the full series today**. There is no tier control. The gap #553 closes is *upward* exposure (PM/PMO/cross-team), not the team's own read.
- **#854** — velocity/throughput rollup opt-in: 0.2 shipped a program rollup with no team-consent layer. Needs a per-project *consent* toggle (default OFF) before any program rollup exposes the metric.
- **#923** — retro team-health pulse: a single-team mood/energy poll inside the live retro board (#851). Ships **only** if team-private by default, opt-in to share, with the same posture as #553; a PM/PMO-visible-by-default pulse is a burnout-surveillance instrument and an instant 🔴.

**P3M layer**: Programs and Projects / Operations — single-project, team-scoped self-governance. **OSS** (the controls, the gate, the defaults, the consent record). Cross-team aggregation (velocity rollup #140, coaching-maturity dashboard #141, portfolio sprint-scope approval #142) is **Enterprise**, already filed in `trueppm-enterprise` at milestone 1.0 — this ADR defines the OSS *extension point* they register against; it does **not** build the cross-team feature.

### Grounding in the actual code (verified 2026-05-31)

1. **`ProjectGuardrailPolicy`** (`apps/projects/models.py:2330`, `VersionedModel`, OneToOne→Project, JSON levels map, `HistoricalRecords`) is the exact singleton-companion shape to mirror.
2. **`velocity_summary`** returns the band (`forecast_range_low`/`high`, `rolling_avg_points`/`stdev`) AND the raw `sprints[]` series (`services.py:445`). Its endpoint `ProjectVelocityView` (`views.py:6182`) gates on `IsProjectMember` — **membership-only, no role floor** (`permissions.py:101-125`): every VIEWER+ member reads the full series today. The suppression gate strips the series, keeps the band, **only when a team raises the audience above a reader's tier** — the default keeps today's any-member read intact (see §1).
3. **`RetroVisibility`** (`models.py:1941`: `TEAM_ONLY`/`PROJECT`/`ORG`, default `TEAM_ONLY`) gates `SprintRetro.team_visibility` (line 1976) — a project-*breadth* axis, NOT a management-*tier* axis. It is reconciled, not overloaded.
4. **`_membership_role(request, project_id)`** (`access/permissions.py:48`) returns `None` for a non-member and is per-request cached — the back-door close.
5. **Role ordinals** (`access/models.py`): VIEWER=0, MEMBER=100, SCHEDULER=200 ("Resource Manager"), ADMIN=300 ("Project Manager"), OWNER=400. The PM is ADMIN. There is no PO/SM ordinal; PO/SM is an agile *hat* (ADR-0101/0102), and the Team facet (`is_product_owner`) is in ADR-0078 (Proposed) — not yet in code.
6. **No OSS program/PMO velocity rollup endpoint exists** — the enterprise rollup is a future consumer.

### Forces

1. **Morgan's velocity-privacy hard-NO (🔴 if wrong)**: team metrics are team-private by default with no automatic velocity→PMO pipeline; sharing *upward* is explicit, team-owned, revocable, and enforced in OSS core. Critically, this means the team must NOT lose visibility of its OWN velocity — the sensitive direction is upward, and the default must not silently demote the team's existing read.
2. **Three controls, one mental model**: #553 (enum), #854 (consent toggle), #923 (pulse visibility) must compose on a single abstraction; the SM ratchet-down to team-only must be a first-class one-click move.
3. **Distinct per-signal defaults are required**: the pulse default MUST be strictly more private than velocity, and the velocity default must preserve today's any-member team read.
4. **Reconcile, don't overload `RetroVisibility`** (wrong axis).
5. **RBAC primitive**: a non-member (the only way an org/PMO principal arrives) is structurally below the lowest tier (the back-door close).
6. **Suppress, don't 403**: aggregates (milestone health, schedule confidence, action-item counts) stay visible; the gated detail (velocity points, pulse values, raw notes) is suppressed.
7. **The VoC-chosen UI is the ladder (Option A)** — a per-signal *ratchet within a team-set ceiling* (the matrix is retained only as a read-only "who sees what" lens). Its defining mechanic is a **ceiling**: the team authorizes how far a signal may be exposed, and day-to-day movement happens below that line. A single audience value per signal cannot represent this, and — crucially — leaves the PM able to raise exposure unilaterally; the model must carry a ceiling and gate raising it as a team-owned act (§1.1).

## Decision

### §1 — One model, one ladder, per-signal audience + ceiling

**New singleton `ProjectSignalPrivacyPolicy`** (`apps/projects`, OneToOne→`Project`, `get_or_create` lazily on first GET, PATCH-only — the `ProjectGuardrailPolicy` shape exactly; `VersionedModel` + `HistoricalRecords`; declare `objects = models.Manager()` explicitly per the cross-app stubs convention):

- `signal_visibility = models.JSONField(default=dict, blank=True)` — maps each signal key to a **`{audience, ceiling}`** pair (both `SignalAudience`; invariant `audience <= ceiling`, enforced in the serializer + `set_signal_audience` service — a JSON map can't carry a per-key DB `CheckConstraint`). An absent signal — or an absent `ceiling` — falls back to its coded default (§1.1). JSON so a future signal needs no migration. *(The original single-value-per-signal shape is superseded by §1.1; see Alternatives F.)*
- `HistoricalRecords(...)` — every audience **and ceiling** change is attributable (§4).

**One ordered audience enum** (pin via `ENUM_NAME_OVERRIDES`):

```
class SignalAudience(models.TextChoices):
    TEAM           = "team",           "Team only"            # MEMBER+ on the project
    TEAM_SM        = "team_sm",        "Team + Scrum Master"  # adds the SM/coach lifecycle hat
    TEAM_SM_PM     = "team_sm_pm",     "Team + SM + PM"       # adds role >= ADMIN (the PM)
    PROGRAM_SHARED = "program_shared", "Shared to program rollup (opt-in)"  # only level the enterprise rollup may read
```

`PROGRAM_SHARED` is the **single opt-in level** that makes a signal eligible for the cross-team rollup (§3). The same enum is used **twice per signal**: as the **audience** (where the signal sits now) and as the **ceiling** (the furthest the team has authorized). §1.1 defines how each is moved.

**Three signal keys + their defaults** — both an **audience** (current) and a **ceiling** (team-authorized max); the defaults *are* the VoC posture:

| Signal key | Default audience | Default ceiling | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `velocity` | `TEAM` | `TEAM` | #553: the team (ordinary members + SM) keeps its existing read, but the **PM band is excluded by default** — defaulting the *audience* above TEAM would share the series up to the PM automatically (Morgan's hard-NO: no automatic velocity→PMO pipeline). Ceiling `TEAM` means velocity is **team-private by default but the team can raise the ceiling** — sharing up is explicit, team-owned, revocable (Morgan). Not the mock's permanent hard-lock; not a PM-raisable free opt-up (§1.1). |
| `throughput_rollup` | `TEAM` | `PROGRAM_SHARED` | #854: the per-project rollup opt-in *is* raising the audience to `PROGRAM_SHARED`; the ceiling already permits it, so the consent is a one-step team act rather than a ceiling-raise + audience-raise. |
| `pulse` | `TEAM` | `TEAM` | #923 🔴: most private; locked to team by default, team-raisable only. |

Every signal's **audience** defaults to `TEAM` — nothing is exposed upward by default. The **ceiling** encodes how far a signal *may* be taken: `TEAM` for the two most sensitive (velocity, pulse) so even raising is a deliberate team act, `PROGRAM_SHARED` for the rollup-consent signal whose entire purpose is opt-in. There is no code path that defaults any **audience** above `TEAM`.

**SM one-click ratchet-down (Morgan's explicit ask).** `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/signal-privacy/ratchet-down/` sets **every** signal's audience to `TEAM` in one call (the facilitator-facet gate of §1.1; interim `role >= Role.ADMIN`, project member). Idempotent; writes one audited history entry per changed signal; never touches ceilings (it is the convenience form of the *set-audience* write in §1.1).

**Reconciling `RetroVisibility`.** `SprintRetro.team_visibility` stays as-is, gating a *single retro's free-text notes* (project breadth). The **pulse trend** (the #923 signal that could leak upward) is governed by `signal_visibility['pulse']` (management tier), NOT by `RetroVisibility`. No fourth switch.

### §1.1 — Per-signal ceiling and the raise/ratchet split (DA-07 ladder reconciliation)

The VoC-selected UI is **Option A — the ladder** (the matrix is retained only as a read-only "who sees what" lens — same data, the ceiling as the 🔒 column and the audience as the filled cells). The ladder's defining mechanic is a per-signal **ceiling**: the team authorizes how far a signal *may* be exposed, and day-to-day movement happens *below* that line. A single `SignalAudience` per signal cannot express this, and — more than a cosmetic gap — with `role >= Role.ADMIN` as the only writer it leaves **the PM able to raise a team's velocity to `PROGRAM_SHARED` unilaterally**, exposing it to the program rollup with no team act. That is the sprint-sovereignty hole the ceiling closes. The model therefore carries two values per signal and splits the write into two gates:

**Two values.** Each signal carries `audience` (where it sits now) and `ceiling` (the furthest the team has authorized), with the invariant `audience <= ceiling` enforced in the serializer and the `set_signal_audience` / `raise_signal_ceiling` services.

**Two writes, two gates:**

1. **Set audience within `[TEAM, ceiling]`** — the day-to-day move (tighten, or loosen up to the ceiling). Gated to the **Scrum-Master facilitator facet** (`TeamMembership.is_scrum_master`, ADR-0078 / #927); **interim `role >= Role.ADMIN`** until #927 lands in 0.3. Audited. `ratchet-down/` (§1) is its one-click "all audiences to `TEAM`" form.
2. **Raise the ceiling** — authorizing *wider* exposure. This is the **team-owned** act, not a facilitator/PM convenience. 0.3 ships it gated to the facilitator / `role >= Role.ADMIN`, **audited, emitted as a team-visible event, and anchored in the retro UI** ("set in retro"); the genuine team vote/ratification that replaces this interim gate is deferred to **0.4** (filed follow-up). **Lowering** a ceiling is always allowed (more private) and clamps `audience` down with it.

**Velocity & health resolution.** Their default `ceiling = TEAM` makes them team-only out of the box, but because a ceiling-raise is a team-owned act, a team that genuinely wants to publish its velocity still can — honoring Morgan's "sharing up is explicit, team-owned, revocable" rather than the mock's permanent hard-lock, while making a *PM-initiated* raise structurally impossible.

**The reader gate is unchanged.** `audience_can_read` (§2) consults only `audience`; `ceiling` bounds *writes*, never reads. `get_shared_team_signals` (§3) keys on `audience == PROGRAM_SHARED` (reachable only once the team raised the ceiling there). Rungs map 1:1 to the ladder: `TEAM`=Team-only, `TEAM_SM`=Scrum Master, `TEAM_SM_PM`=Project·PM, `PROGRAM_SHARED`=Org (= program/workspace scope, OSS — not portfolio).

### §2 — Server-side suppression gate

A single OSS service helper owns the decision:

```
def audience_can_read(policy, signal_key, requester_tier) -> bool
def requester_signal_tier(request, project_id) -> SignalAudience | below-team sentinel
```

`requester_signal_tier` derives the reader **band** from `_membership_role(request, project_id)`. The ladder measures management distance, and a signal is read iff the requester's band is **within** the audience (`tier <= audience`):
- `None` (non-member — the only way an org/PMO principal arrives) → **outside the ladder** → denied for every signal **regardless of role ordinal** (the back-door close; an Enterprise custom role above `OWNER` that is not a project member has no `ProjectMembership` row and cannot pass).
- `>= Role.ADMIN` → **PM / management band** (`TEAM_SM_PM`). This band is excluded from a signal until the team raises that signal's audience to include it. The PO role (#496) maps here when it lands.
- `Role.MEMBER` / `Role.VIEWER`, **and the Scrum Master**, → `TEAM` band. The team — including the SM, a team insider — is the ladder floor and therefore **always** reads its own signals (the SM facet grants the *write* gate, not a different read band).

The three read paths call the gate **before** assembling the gated numbers and **suppress** (not 403) when the requester's band is **outside** the signal's configured audience (`tier > audience`):

1. **`velocity_summary` read** — when `tier > signal_visibility['velocity']`, the `sprints[]` series + rolling points / sparkline are omitted; the milestone-health % and schedule confidence remain. At the `TEAM` default the team band passes (so every *ordinary member's* read is byte-for-byte unchanged from today — no regression), while the **PM band is suppressed — the PM does not read velocity automatically (Morgan's hard-NO)**. A team raising velocity's audience to `TEAM_SM_PM` is what *shares it up* to the PM; a non-member is always denied.
2. **Milestone rollup payload** (`compute_milestone_rollup_payload`) — the velocity/throughput point cells suppressed for the PM band until the team shares `['velocity']` / `['throughput_rollup']` up to it; the % completion stays.
3. **Pulse-trend read** (new #923 endpoint) — the per-sprint mood/energy series returned only when `tier <= signal_visibility['pulse']` (team band by default); for any band above the audience it is omitted **entirely** (a redacted pulse is no pulse — there is no safe aggregate fallback).

### §3 — Enterprise cross-team extension point (consumes opt-in only; non-consenting team excluded, not zero-filled)

Two OSS surfaces, both supply-only:

- **`get_shared_team_signals(project) -> dict | None`** (new `signal_privacy_services.py`). Returns a dict of *only* the signals whose configured audience == `PROGRAM_SHARED`; returns **`None`** when the project shared nothing. Because all three signals default to `TEAM`, a project that has changed nothing shares nothing — opt-in is strictly explicit. Invariant: **a non-consenting team is EXCLUDED (the consumer skips a `None`), never zero-filled** — a zero-fill would let a PMO infer non-sharing or dilute an aggregate, pressuring opt-in.
- **`team_signal_consent_changed = django.dispatch.Signal()`** (`projects/signals.py`) — emitted on every audience change. OSS only emits; Enterprise connects a receiver in `AppConfig.ready()` (the established `risk_changed` / `sprint_scope_changed` pattern; receiver I/O deferred with `transaction.on_commit()`).

**The resolver is supply-only — no auto-share path** (mirrors the ADR-0102 §3 / ADR-0101 `guardrail_policy_resolving` read-only invariant): there is no field, signal, or hook by which an external/enterprise actor can *set*, default, or upgrade a project's audience or ceiling. The **only** writers of `signal_visibility` are the two human-invoked, project-member-gated team endpoints of §1.1 — set-audience (facilitator facet; interim `role >= Role.ADMIN`) and raise-ceiling (team-owned; 0.3: facilitator / `role >= Role.ADMIN` + audit + team-visible event + retro-anchored). Neither value can be moved by any non-team principal.

**Coupling with the bridge forecast seam.** The companion Agile/Waterfall Bridge ADR fires a `milestone_forecast_recomputed` signal carrying a milestone confidence band. That band is a team signal and is cross-team-eligible **only** when the project's `signal_visibility['throughput_rollup']` (or `['velocity']` as configured) is `PROGRAM_SHARED`. Since both default to `TEAM`, the band does not flow cross-team until a team explicitly opts in. The bridge seam therefore composes with `get_shared_team_signals` rather than bypassing it — there is one consent boundary, not two.

### §4 — Consent change is audited (who flipped sharing on/off)

`ProjectSignalPrivacyPolicy` carries `HistoricalRecords`, so every audience **and ceiling** change is captured with actor + timestamp. The set-audience / raise-ceiling / ratchet endpoints write `history_change_reason` (e.g. `"velocity audience: team -> team_sm"`, `"velocity ceiling: team -> program_shared (team-owned raise)"`) so the timeline classifies the change (ADR-0096/0098 pattern); a ceiling raise is the audit row that matters most — it is the team's recorded decision to permit wider exposure. The audit is **team-readable-first** — it follows the existing project history-endpoint RBAC, honoring the tier-2 sprint-sovereignty rule that team audits are team-readable before management-readable. The `team_signal_consent_changed` signal additionally lets an Enterprise immutable-audit receiver capture upward-share decisions, but the OSS history is the source of truth.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: one `ProjectSignalPrivacyPolicy` singleton, one `SignalAudience` ladder, per-signal JSON map with distinct defaults (all `TEAM` — velocity regression-preserving, throughput/pulse never-leaked), suppress-gate in a shared service, supply-only consent-gated enterprise provider (chosen)** | Three controls on one mental model; the velocity `TEAM` default preserves today's any-member read (no regression) while still blocking upward exposure; per-signal defaults satisfy 'pulse strictest'; reuses the `ProjectGuardrailPolicy` idiom; back-door closed via `_membership_role`; opt-in stays team-owned; a future signal needs no migration; one consent boundary shared with the bridge seam | A second policy singleton on `Project`; the gate must be remembered in any *new* signal read path (mitigated by the single helper + a test) |
| A′: default velocity to `TEAM_SM_PM` | Symmetric upper-tier framing | Suppresses the velocity series for ordinary VIEWER+ members who read it today (ground truth: membership-only endpoint) — a downward regression on exactly Morgan's surface, and the 'no regression — PM-readable' rationale that justified it was factually inverted. Rejected for `TEAM`. |
| B: three independent fields on `Project` (#553's literal proposal) | Smallest diff | Three inconsistent switches — exactly what Morgan forbids; SM ratchet-down touches three unrelated fields; a fourth signal repeats the divergence |
| C: extend `RetroVisibility` to cover all three signals | Reuses a shipped enum | Wrong axis (project breadth, not tier); no `PROGRAM_SHARED` rung; overloading breaks retro free-text gating + sync payload. Rejected — reconcile, don't overload. |
| D: enterprise rollup zero-fills non-consenting teams | Cleaner cross-team math | Zero-fill lets a PMO infer non-sharing and pressures opt-in — Morgan 🔴. Rejected; non-consenting teams excluded. |
| E: a resolver that can *set* a default org audience | Org can enforce a baseline | Any external write path to `signal_visibility` is an automatic velocity→PMO pipeline by another name (Morgan 🔴). Rejected — supply/read-only. |
| F: single `SignalAudience` per signal, no ceiling (this ADR's original shape) | Smallest model; one value to reason about | Its only writer is `role >= Role.ADMIN`, so **the PM can unilaterally raise team velocity to `PROGRAM_SHARED`** with no team act — the sprint-sovereignty hole. And the VoC-chosen ladder UI is built around a team ceiling this shape cannot represent. Superseded by §1.1 (per-signal `{audience, ceiling}` + raise/ratchet split). |

## Consequences

**Easier**: a team learns one privacy model and applies it to velocity, rollup, and pulse identically; the team keeps its current velocity read by default (no regression); the SM makes everything team-private in one click and can prove (audited) who changed sharing; raising a signal's exposure is a team-owned, audited **ceiling** change — a PM can never widen it unilaterally; the OSS/Enterprise privacy line is a named, supply-only, consent-gated extension point #140/#141/#142 register against; Marcus still sees milestone health + schedule confidence (never gated). The bridge forecast band shares this one consent boundary.

**Harder**: a second policy singleton joins `ProjectGuardrailPolicy` on `Project`; any *new* team-signal reader must route through `audience_can_read` or it re-leaks (mitigated by the single helper + a regression test); the two visibility axes (`RetroVisibility` breadth vs `SignalAudience` tier) must be kept distinct in UI and docs.

**Risks**: (1) forgotten gate on a future signal — mitigated by centralizing in `audience_can_read` + a test that the three known paths suppress. (2) drf-spectacular enum collision on `SignalAudience` — pin via `ENUM_NAME_OVERRIDES` in the same MR. (3) non-member tier mapping drift — `_membership_role(...) is None → below TEAM` is the entire back-door close; unit-tested with an org-principal-without-membership fixture (the 🔴 test). (4) the pulse-trend read must never fall back to a redacted aggregate — a below-tier requester gets *no* trend, asserted by test. (5) a velocity-default regression — guarded by a pytest asserting a plain MEMBER's `velocity_summary` read at the default policy is byte-for-byte identical to today (no series suppression at the `TEAM` default). (6) the `audience <= ceiling` invariant — enforced in the serializer + `set_signal_audience`/`raise_signal_ceiling` services (a JSON map cannot carry a per-key DB `CheckConstraint`), with tests that a set-audience above the ceiling is rejected (`400`), that the PM-tier cannot raise a ceiling outside the team-owned endpoint, and that lowering a ceiling clamps the audience down with it.

## Implementation Notes
- **P3M layer**: Programs and Projects / Operations (single-project, team-scoped). Cross-team rollup is Portfolios → Enterprise.
- **Affected packages**: api (`ProjectSignalPrivacyPolicy` singleton with per-signal `{audience, ceiling}`, `SignalAudience` enum, `audience_can_read`/`requester_signal_tier` gate, `set_signal_audience` / `raise_signal_ceiling` services + the `audience <= ceiling` invariant, suppression in `velocity_summary` read/`compute_milestone_rollup_payload`/pulse-trend read, `get_shared_team_signals` provider, `team_signal_consent_changed` signal, the set-audience / raise-ceiling / ratchet endpoints; pulse models for #923 — `TeamHealthPulse`/`PulseResponse` under the live retro board #851); web (the **ladder** Signal Privacy settings panel + the read-only matrix lens, the SM ratchet control, the ceiling/🔒 raise affordance, the gated-state renders, the in-retro pulse poll + team-only trend). No scheduler change. Mobile: web-first in 0.3; the policy is `VersionedModel` (sync-ready for 0.4); pulse models defer sync like `SprintRetro`.
- **Migration required**: **yes** — `ProjectSignalPrivacyPolicy` singleton (+ its `HistoricalRecords` table) and the #923 pulse models. All additive; `signal_visibility` JSON default `{}` (no NOT-NULL-without-default hazard; an empty map means every signal resolves to its coded `{audience: TEAM, ceiling: <per §1>}` default). Run `makemigrations` (never hand-write). Do not hard-code the projects-app counter. Land this MR FIRST of the three model-bearing MRs to keep the migration graph linear.
- **API changes**: yes — `ProjectSignalPrivacyPolicy` GET (project member) + two write paths per §1.1: **set-audience** PATCH (within `[TEAM, ceiling]`; facilitator facet, interim `role >= Role.ADMIN`) and **raise-ceiling** `POST /projects/{id}/signal-privacy/raise-ceiling/` (team-owned; 0.3 facilitator / `role >= Role.ADMIN` + audited + team-visible + retro-anchored; 0.4 → team vote); `POST .../ratchet-down/` (audiences → `TEAM`); content suppression on velocity/rollup/pulse-trend reads (no behavior change at the `TEAM` default for in-project members); new pulse endpoints (#923). Regenerate OpenAPI **after merging origin/main**; add `ENUM_NAME_OVERRIDES` for `SignalAudience`.
- **OSS or Enterprise**: **OSS** — policy, gate, defaults, consent record, and `get_shared_team_signals` are OSS. The cross-team rollup (#140), coaching-maturity dashboard (#141), portfolio sprint-scope approval (#142) are Enterprise (1.0), registering against `get_shared_team_signals` + `team_signal_consent_changed`. OSS never imports `trueppm_enterprise`.
- **Coordinate with**: #553 (this ADR replaces its single-enum-on-`Project` proposal; the velocity default is `TEAM`, preserving today's read), #854 (the `throughput_rollup` signal + `PROGRAM_SHARED` opt-in is its implementation), #923 (pulse default `TEAM` + suppression satisfies its 🔴), #851 (the pulse lives in the live retro board), **#927** (the Team-entity + `is_scrum_master`/`is_product_owner` facet axis, pulled into 0.3 — the set-audience and PO tier gates wire to its facets; the interim `role >= Role.ADMIN` gates here are the fallback only if #927 slips within 0.3), #496 (PO = `is_product_owner` facet, resolves to the PM tier), ADR-0078 (the facet design), ADR-0101/0102 (the singleton + external-inertness + `_membership_role` back-door-close patterns; ADR-0102's scope gate likewise migrates to the PO/facilitator facet), the **0.4 team-vote follow-up** (replaces the interim raise-ceiling gate), and the **Agile/Waterfall Bridge ADR** (the forecast band shares this consent boundary; nothing flows upward until a team raises a signal's ceiling to and sets its audience at `PROGRAM_SHARED`).
- **Security & privacy (threat-model follow-up)**: warrant a `/threat-model` pass confirming (a) a non-member org principal is denied every signal regardless of role ordinal, (b) no write path to `signal_visibility` outside the gated team endpoint, (c) the provider returns `None` (omits) for non-consenting signals, (d) the velocity `TEAM` default preserves the current any-member read.
- **Testing** (three-layer, same MR): pytest — each signal's default audience (all `TEAM`); **a plain `MEMBER`'s `velocity_summary` read at the default policy is byte-for-byte unchanged from today — the velocity-regression guard**; **a non-member high-ordinal actor cannot read any signal (the 🔴 back-door test)**; **the PM band does not read velocity at the default and after a team opts velocity *up* to `TEAM_SM_PM` the PM reads it (Morgan's hard-NO — team-private by default, shared upward explicitly), while ordinary members read throughout**; the PM band gets *no* pulse trend until the team shares the pulse up; `get_shared_team_signals` returns `None`/omits for non-consented signals and the consented payload only at `PROGRAM_SHARED`; no non-endpoint code path writes `signal_visibility`; consent change writes `history_change_reason`; the ratchet sets all three audiences to `TEAM` in one audited call. **Ceiling invariant (§1.1):** set-audience above `ceiling` is rejected `400`; the set-audience endpoint cannot move a ceiling; raise-ceiling is gated and audited with a team-visible event; lowering a ceiling clamps the audience down; a PM-tier seat (without the team-owned raise) can never push a signal's audience past its ceiling. vitest — the **ladder** panel state + the read-only matrix lens, the SM ratchet control, the ceiling/🔒 raise affordance, the gated empty-state renders. Playwright — golden path (facilitator raises velocity's ceiling in-retro, sets audience to PM, then ratchets to team-only; pulse answered in-retro is team-visible; a PM-tier seat sees aggregate-only) + one share path (team raises a signal's ceiling to and sets audience at `PROGRAM_SHARED`).

### Durable Execution
1. **Broker-down**: policy PATCH/ratchet and pulse answers are **synchronous DB writes** — no durability gap. The only async side effect is the best-effort `team_signal_consent_changed` notification, deferred with `transaction.on_commit()`; a broker outage cannot lose the consent decision (the committed DB row), only delay the enterprise cache invalidation, which self-heals on the next rollup read.
2. **Drain task**: none new — the consent signal is a synchronous in-process dispatch; any Enterprise receiver's own I/O uses its own outbox/drain.
3. **Orphan window**: N/A — writes are synchronous and committed before the on-commit signal fires.
4. **Service layer**: all transitions go through `signal_privacy_services.py` (`set_signal_audience`, `ratchet_down_to_team`, `get_shared_team_signals`, `audience_can_read`, `requester_signal_tier`); no bare `.delay()`; the consent signal fires inside `transaction.on_commit()`.
5. **API response**: PATCH/ratchet return synchronous `200`; the consent signal is fire-and-forget. Reads return `200` with the suppressed payload.
6. **Outbox cleanup**: nothing new — synchronous dispatch; any Enterprise receiver owns its own retention.
7. **Idempotency**: setting an audience to its current value is a no-op (value guard, no history row); the ratchet is idempotent. `get_shared_team_signals` is a pure read.
8. **Dead-letter / failure**: a failed receiver never blocks or reverts the consent write (the DB row is durable); a dropped signal self-heals because the provider reads live DB state on the next rollup.

## Decisions pending your sign-off

This ADR is **Proposed**. The following choices encode a defensible default but are flagged for review at MR time:

1. **Velocity default = `audience: TEAM`, `ceiling: TEAM`** — *resolved 2026-06-02.* Team-only by default and **raisable only by the team-owned ceiling act** (§1.1). The PM (ADMIN) no longer reads velocity automatically and **cannot unilaterally expose it** — closing the PM-raise hole that the original single-value shape (Alternative F) left open. This supersedes both the cluster's original `TEAM_SM_PM` default and the mock's permanent hard-lock; it honors Morgan's "sharing up is explicit, team-owned, revocable."
2. **Per-signal ceiling + raise/ratchet split (§1.1)** — *adopted 2026-06-02* to back the VoC-chosen ladder UI (Option A) and make upward exposure a team-owned, audited act. The two write gates: set-audience (facilitator facet) within `[TEAM, ceiling]`; raise-ceiling (team-owned). Confirm.
3. **Interim gates, retired by #927.** The set-audience and PO-tier gates ship an interim `role >= Role.ADMIN` mapping only until the `is_scrum_master`/`is_product_owner` facets land — now pulled into **0.3 as #927** (carved from #599). If #927 lands first, this ADR wires the facets directly and the interim gate is unused. Confirm the interim gate as the fallback if intra-0.3 sequencing slips.
4. **Team vote deferred to 0.4.** The 0.3 raise-ceiling gate (facilitator / `role >= Role.ADMIN` + audit + team-visible + retro-anchored) is replaced by a genuine team vote/ratification in 0.4 (filed follow-up). Confirm the 0.3 interim is acceptable. — *Resolved by Amendment A below (#930).*

## Amendment A — Team ratification flow for ceiling raises (#930, 0.4)

**Status**: Accepted (2026-06-21). Implements §1.1 decision 4 and the "0.4 team vote" deferral. Backend slice (propose/vote/ratify API + models); the web surface (pending-proposal indicator, in-retro vote affordance) is a tracked follow-up.

### A.1 — The single behavior change

The §1.1 raise-ceiling gate stops being single-actor. A request to set a signal's ceiling **higher on the ladder** (`signal_audience_rank(new) > current`) no longer applies immediately — it opens a **ratification proposal** and the raise takes effect **only when the team ratifies**. Everything else is unchanged and stays single-action, because tightening is never gated heavier than loosening:

- **Lowering** a ceiling (`rank(new) <= current`) — applies immediately via the existing `raise_signal_ceiling` (it already clamps the audience down). No proposal.
- **Set-audience** within `[TEAM, ceiling]` and **ratchet-down** — unchanged, immediate, facilitator/Admin.

The hole is closed **at the API layer in this slice**, with or without the web UI: the existing `POST .../signal-privacy/raise-ceiling/` returns **`202` + the open proposal** instead of applying, the moment a raise is requested. There is no window where a lone facilitator can still apply a raise.

### A.2 — Threshold (resolved)

Eligibility and the bar are computed **server-side at every tally** (so roster changes are reflected live):

- **Eligible voters** = non-deleted `TeamMembership` rows on the project's **default team** (`team__is_default=True`). This is the team roster (#927), **not** project membership — a non-team project-Admin/PM has no vote (Morgan: prevents vote-stuffing from outside the team). A project-Admin who *is* on the team votes as one member; SM/PO facets carry **no extra weight** (one member, one vote).
- **Threshold** = `floor(eligible / 2) + 1` — **strict majority** of the current roster. This yields: 1→1, 2→2, 3→2, 4→3, 5→3. For any team of **≥ 2** members the proposer's own approval (1) never meets the bar, so **a lone facilitator can never raise alone** — at least one *other* member must approve. A 1-member team is the degenerate case: there is no other member to consult, so the proposer's approval ratifies (the rule protects members' consent from a facilitator; with no other members there is nothing to protect). Not unanimity, not whole-roster, so one disengaged member can never deadlock a raise (Alex/Morgan).

### A.3 — Proposal lifecycle, voting, expiry (resolved)

- **Who proposes**: the existing raise-ceiling gate — facilitator (`is_scrum_master`) **or** `role >= Role.ADMIN` who is a team member. (Minimal change; keeping propose authority where it is avoids a second migration of who-can-write while the ratification itself is what makes it team-owned.) **Proposing is an implicit APPROVE** — the proposer's vote is auto-recorded on open.
- **Who votes**: any eligible team member (A.2). One vote per member (`unique(proposal, voter)`), changeable while the proposal is `OPEN` (upsert).
- **Tally on every vote** (and on open): `APPROVE >= threshold` → **RATIFIED**, apply the raise; else if `REJECT > eligible - threshold` (approval can no longer reach the bar) → **REJECTED**; else stays `OPEN`.
- **One open proposal per `(project, signal)`** — a partial unique constraint (`status = OPEN`). A second raise request for the same signal while one is open returns **`409`** (no superseding-proposal loop — see A.4). The proposer may **withdraw** their own open proposal (→ `REJECTED`, reason "withdrawn by proposer").
- **Expiry**: `expires_at = created_at + SIGNAL_CEILING_PROPOSAL_TTL` (default **72 h** — long enough for an async team, short enough to not stall the PM; Morgan/Sarah). Evaluated **lazily** — any read (GET), vote, or new-proposal attempt first transitions a past-due `OPEN` proposal to **EXPIRED**. An expired proposal **dies UNRATIFIED**: the ceiling is unchanged, the outcome is explicit in the record. **Silence is never consent** for *widening* exposure — there is no auto-apply-on-timeout (David's auto-ratify-on-silence is rejected for exactly this reason). Lazy evaluation needs no Celery/Beat (no async, no outbox).

### A.4 — Anti-gaming (resolved)

- **One-open-per-signal** + `409` removes the supersede loop.
- **Lower-then-raise clock reset**: applying a ceiling **lower** (immediate) while a raise proposal is `OPEN` for that signal **supersedes** it (→ `SUPERSEDED`, reason recorded) — the proposal was relative to the old baseline, so a fresh proposal + fresh vote is required. The transition is audited, so the lower→raise pattern is **visible in the record**, not a silent clock reset.
- **Apply re-resolves the baseline**: on ratification the raise is applied through the existing `raise_signal_ceiling` against the *current* resolved ceiling; if the team already raised it by other means it is a no-op (the existing value guard), never a surprise double-jump.

### A.5 — Rejected: a PMO/exec override that bypasses the vote

The VoC panel's Marcus/Janet 🔴 ask — an Admin/PMO/exec path that reads or raises the ceiling *without* the team vote — is **explicitly rejected**. It is the §2 back-door by another name: the entire model exists so the PM does **not** read velocity automatically (Morgan's hard-NO) and cannot widen exposure unilaterally. A management bypass would re-open precisely the hole §1.1 closed. Portfolio-layer governance (a cross-program approval workflow that *can* compel sharing) is an **Enterprise** concern and a different feature; the OSS team-ratification here is single-team, team-owned, and has no bypass. This is consistent with the boundary test — a team needs this to run its own program; it is not cross-program governance.

### A.6 — Data model, API, audit

- **`SignalCeilingRaiseProposal`** (plain `models.Model`, projects app — a server-side governance record, **not** offline-synced, mirroring `SprintScopeChange`/`TaskDurationChangeEvent`/`AuditEvent`; **no** `server_version`): `id` (UUID), `project` FK, `signal_key`, `from_ceiling`, `to_ceiling` (`SignalAudience`), `proposed_by` FK (SET_NULL), `status` (`OPEN/RATIFIED/REJECTED/EXPIRED/SUPERSEDED`, default `OPEN`), `created_at`, `expires_at`, `resolved_at` (null until it leaves OPEN). Partial unique `(project, signal_key) WHERE status=open`; index `(project, signal_key, status)`.
- **`SignalCeilingRaiseVote`** (plain `models.Model`): `id` (UUID), `proposal` FK (`related_name="votes"`, CASCADE), `voter` FK, `choice` (`APPROVE/REJECT`), `created_at`. `unique(proposal, voter)` — the `PulseResponse` one-vote-per-member template.
- **API**: `POST .../signal-privacy/raise-ceiling/` → `202` + proposal on a raise (or `200` + policy on a lower/no-op or immediate ratify of a solo team); `POST .../signal-privacy/ceiling-proposals/{id}/vote/` `{choice}` → `200` + proposal (may carry the now-applied policy when the vote ratifies); `GET .../signal-privacy/ceiling-proposals/` lists open + recent-resolved proposals with their votes (team-readable); `GET .../signal-privacy/` gains an `open_proposals` block per signal (`to_ceiling`, `approve_count`, `threshold`, `eligible_count`, `expires_at`, `your_vote`, `can_vote`) — Sarah's pending indicator. Both POSTs carry the `IdempotencyMixin` (`select_for_update` on the proposal makes the tally/apply idempotent; the vote is an upsert; ratify applies once via the `status==OPEN` guard).
- **Audit / team-readability**: the proposal + each vote ARE the audit record (Alex: team-readable, not just an admin log) — visible to every project member via the list endpoint. Applying the raise additionally writes the policy's `history_change_reason` and fires the existing `team_signal_consent_changed` on commit (the Enterprise seam). A new consumer-free `team_signal_ceiling_proposal_changed` signal fires on every status transition (open/ratify/reject/expire/supersede) on commit — same supply-only seam pattern, so Enterprise immutable-audit can observe proposal lifecycle. **No email/push** is wired (Priya's hard-NO on un-opted notification); the pending state is pull-only via GET.

### A.7 — Durable Execution (amendment)

1. **Broker-down**: N/A — propose/vote/ratify are synchronous DB writes; ratification applies the ceiling in-request. The only async-ish side effects are the two best-effort `on_commit` signals (`team_signal_consent_changed`, `team_signal_ceiling_proposal_changed`), which only delay an Enterprise cache invalidation, never lose the committed decision.
2. **Drain task**: none — no `.delay()`.
3. **Orphan window**: N/A — writes commit before the on-commit signals fire; expiry is lazy on read/vote/propose (no background sweep, no orphan rows that change state).
4. **Service layer**: new `signal_privacy_services.py` functions — `propose_or_apply_ceiling_change` (routes raise→propose, lower→apply), `cast_ceiling_vote`, `_tally_and_maybe_apply`, `expire_stale_proposals`, `list_team_voters`.
5. **API response**: `202 {proposal}` when a raise is deferred to the vote; `200` on a lower, an immediate solo-team ratify, and on a vote.
6. **Outbox cleanup**: N/A — no outbox.
7. **Idempotency**: `select_for_update` on the proposal during vote/tally; vote is `update_or_create` (unique `proposal+voter`); the apply runs once behind the `status==OPEN`→`RATIFIED` guard, and `raise_signal_ceiling`'s value guard makes a re-apply a no-op.
8. **Dead-letter / failure**: synchronous; validation → `400`, conflict (no open proposal / already resolved / vote-by-non-member) → `409`/`403`. No async permanent-failure path.

### A.8 — Implementation notes (amendment)

- **Migration**: yes — `projects/0089` (two additive plain models). No change to `ProjectSignalPrivacyPolicy`.
- **OSS or Enterprise**: **OSS** — single-team, team-owned ratification (Programs/Projects layer). The cross-program approval-workflow variant is Enterprise and out of scope here.
- **Testing** (pytest, same MR): a raise opens a proposal and does **not** apply until ratified; a **lone facilitator cannot raise alone** on a ≥2-member team (proposer's auto-approve stays OPEN); a second approver ratifies and the ceiling applies + writes history; a **non-team project-Admin cannot vote** (`403`); votes are recorded and team-readable; a lower stays immediate and **supersedes** an open raise proposal; an expired proposal stays UNRATIFIED on the next read; a second open proposal for the same signal is `409`; **no PMO bypass exists**. (web vitest/Playwright land with the deferred web surface.)
